Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pooler.dense.bias', 'pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
